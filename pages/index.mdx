# Zach Parkhurst

Hey, I'm a student studying Computer Science at Marywood University. I enjoy working with Next.js and crafting beautiful front-end experiences. I also have experience in C++ and Python. However, Next.js has been really enjoyable as of late.

This portfolio is built with **Next.js** and a library called [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app/). It allows you to write Markdown to manipulate your page and add content with ease.
